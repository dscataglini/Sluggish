= Sluggish

Creates a shortcut alias for find_by_(name|slug|key) as [] so that you can call MyModel[:foo] and it will find it.
A possible usage would be for common queries like User.find_by_email. 
The setup would be

  Class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    include Sluggish
    sluggit! :email
  end

  User['foo@example.com'] #=> User.find_by_email('foo@example.com')

== Installation

  gem install Sluggish

== Notes

Relies on the class responding to find_by_(foo)
